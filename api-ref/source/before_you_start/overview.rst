Overview
========

Welcome to *Tag Management Service API Reference*. Tags are used to identify cloud resources. When you have many cloud resources of the same type, you can use tags to classify cloud resources by dimension (for example, use, owner, or environment). Tag Management Service (TMS) is a visualized service for fast and unified cross-region tagging and categorization of cloud services.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on tags, such as creating or deleting predefined tags, and querying or modify predefined tags. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0126416749>`.

If you plan to access TMS through an API, ensure that you are familiar with TMS concepts. For details, see section "Service Overview" in the *Tag Management Service User Guide*.
